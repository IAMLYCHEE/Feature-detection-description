# Feature-detection-description
Analyzing Image Feature Detectors and generate an original descriptor in this project. First studied different detectors mentioned in previous papers and finally decide to use a simplified SIFT algorithm to detect the key points and then use FT and a new coding method to develop a new descriptor to describe a picked image feature.
